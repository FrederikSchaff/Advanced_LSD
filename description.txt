Advanced LSD Modules - ...

Gathering all the stuff under a single theme: Advanced LSD.
Starting with:
ABMAT (analysis only) -> ABMAT Module ; Analysis of ABM
Geo -> GIS Module ; Geography implementation to LSD
Pop -> POP Module ; statistical POPulation model Module
debug -> MAIN Module ; Links all modules, provides debugging utilities, etc.
pajek -> pajek Module ; Descriptive Network Data for visualisation with Pajek. More flexible than standard LSD tool, but only for analysis outside LSD


Uncertain (if needed)
DOE module
ABMAT-advanced  (automatic stopping, etc.)

Once the module is fine, it should be hosted on GIT.


Status:

Population Model module is implemented and runnning fine. Includes a heritage network.
GIS Model is implemented and (as far as tested) running fine. Includes a geo-distance search, with world-wrapping on all four corners switchable.

Most important to do: Document! Test by someone else!

Population Dynamics Template Model

Objective: This is a template model, to be used as a starting point for LSD models where an 
explicit population model is wanted that
- has realistic survival laws, based on few (two) parameters
- yields stable population statistics, if wanted
- includes a heritage network that survives the agents

The template also uses the ABMAT module for automated descriptive analysis of a
single run, and the tools module for debuging and validation information. See
the readmes under the specific externals folders for details.

Design Concepts:
 ;
	A) Representation
	
	In LSD there is an object "Agent". For each such object, an instance of 
	"ext_pop_agent" exists in the backend "ext_pop". The backend is attached
	to the LSD object "Pop_model". Currently only one kind of population is
	possible. Different societies thus need to share the same survival function. 
	[It is possible to differentiate the birth rates, in principle].
	
	The backend keeps track of agents alive and dead. This way, the heritage net-
	work is accesable even if single persons die. For example, even if both 
	parents are dead, one could track the parents and via the parents the siblings
	of an agent, or cousins, etc.
	
	The backend also provides access to a random cycle method for agents currently
	alive via a macro:
	
		cur=NULL; //use the LSD object pointer cur to refer to the agents in the 
							//cycle
		cur1=SEARCH("Pop_model); //the population model LSD object, where the backen
		                         //is hooked
		POP_RCYCLE_AGENTS(cur1,cur){  
			//do something with cur
		}
		
	In the user file "fun_templ_pop" there are the following equations:
	
	EQUATION("Updating_Scheme")	//controls the order in which events happen
		Although not necessary, it is recommended to add user model events to
		this updating scheme, to ensure the correct order (on top of LSD taking 
		care that equations are updated when necessary and at most once per t)
		
	EQUATION("Init_New_Agent") //add stuff that happens when a new agent is 
		created. Called via fake-caller, so c refers to that agent.
	
	EQUATION("Init_Global") Global initialisation.
	
	EQUATION("Delete_Agent") //add stuff that happens when an agent dies. Called 
		via fake-caller, so c refers to that agent.
	
	B) Theory
		1) As an example, we incorporate the (potentially) constant population model 
			from [1], which is both simple and realistic enough.
			- Parameters:
					. alpha (incr: longer life, mainly because young die less)
					. beta (incr: old people benefit more from drop in death rates)
					. n_agent (initial n agents, also in constant birth rate case ~ equilibrium. Remark:1
			- survival function:  S(age) = (exp(-beta * age) - alpha)/(1-alpha)
			- life expectency: 1.0/beta + (alpha * log(alpha) )/ ( (1.0-alpha)*beta)
			- optional: constant birth rate with constant pop size: 1.0/life_expectency (see [2])
		2) We divert from [1], by_ 
		2a) adjusting the setting to a discrete time scenario, 
		   as in [2]
		2b) Providing explicit sex, with a fixed chance of 50% to be female or male. 
		2c) As in [2], assume a constant birth rate as default.

	C) Remarks
		1) The fertility rate and death probabilites can be seen as "under ideal 
			 circumstances", i.e. it is possible to include other causes of death 
			 (like nutrition, migration) or birth (like migration) or skipped birth 
			 (like no suitable parents to be found). This should be directly in LSD, 
			 i.e. "the model". You may "kill" an agent out of the standard procedrue
			 by calling the function "Pop_agent_death" via fake-caller, passing as 
			 fake-caller the agent to be deleted.
		2) If more than one society or group shall be present, this is best 
  		 implemented in the "Init_New_Agent". For example, it could be decided
  		 probabilistically to which group a new agent belongs.
